# Changelog

## Next release

### ✨ Improved

* Use coroutine function in `ensure_future.on_release_callback`.


## 0.5.0 - 2026-01-17

### 🚀 New

### ✨ Improved

* [#15](https://github.com/sdss/lvmcryo/pull/15) `lvmcryo.runner.ln2_runner` can now be called programmatically with the same functionality as the CLI. The CLI has been modified to use `ln2_runner` without changes in behaviour.

## 0.3.6 - 2024-11-29

### ✨ Improved

* Add additional retries for valve and check safe commands.

## 0.2.0 - 2024-10-08

### 🚀 New

* Add option `--require-all-thermistors`. When passed, the thermistors don't close the valve when they become active. Once all thermistors are active, the valves are all closed at the same time. This can potentially prevent overpressures in the last one or two cryostat being filled as the other valves close.
